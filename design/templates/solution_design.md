# Solution Design - Template
[//]: # "Change the title above from 'Template' to your design's title"

[//]: # "General notes:"
[//]: # "1. Design should be graphical-based and table-based - avoid long text explanations" 
[//]: # "2. Design documents should not be updated after implementation"
[//]: # "3.â€¯Design decisions should be made before writing this document, and as such this document should not include options / choices"


## Table of Contents

If there are a few options considered for the solution, mention them and explain why the actual solution was chosen over them. Add an execution plan when relevant. It doesn't have to be a full breakdown of the feature, but just a recommendation to how the solution should be approached."

[//]: # "Describe main flows in system influenced by this design - using sequence diagram UML"

### External Interfaces
[//]: # "Describe SW interfaces to the blocks / classes that are external to this part of of project"
[//]: # "The description should contain full set of parameters per event, as well as method of interaction (sync / async / REST / GRPC / TCP /..)"

## Performance
[//]: # "Describe potential performance issues that might be raised by the system as well as their mitigations"
[//]: # "How does this solution affect the performance of the product?"

## Affected Components
[//]: # "List all components that will be affected by your solution [Conjur OSS, Conjur Enterprise, clients, integrations, etc.] and elaborate on the impacts"
[//]: # "This list should include all downstream components that will need to be updated to consume new releases as these changes are implemented"

## Test Plan

### Test Environments
