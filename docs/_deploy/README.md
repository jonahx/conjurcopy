Build scripts are here instead of the root directory so they
don't end up in the rendered site.

# Building

- Run the following commands in the project root directory:
  - _deploy/build.sh

# Running locally

`_deploy/run.sh` script launches a live-updating Jekyll server, suitable for development.
