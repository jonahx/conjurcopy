# Script to submit simplecov coverage report to Code Climate.  Only one report
# can be submitted per commit, so this can only run once pre build, not for
# each test set.

# The rspec and cucumber reports are all written to repo_root/coverage
# Simplecov handles locking and merging for parallel tests.  The GKE tests
# can't mount that dir, so they produce a separate report which is merged into
# repo_root/coverage by this script.
