Feature: Rotate the API key of a role

  The API key of a role can be automatically changed ("rotated") to a new random string.

  A role can rotate its own API key using the password or current API key. A role can also
  rotate the API key of another role if it has `update` privilege on the role.

  In these test cases, API key rotation is performed against Bob.
  API key rotation is executed by 5 roles:
    - Bob himself
    - a user with update permission, "privileged_user"
    - a user without update permission, "unprivileged_user"
    - a host belonging to a layer with update permission, "privileged_host"
    - a host without update permission, "unprivileged_host"
  These roles attempt to rotate Bob's API key with all authentication methods
  available to them.

  The host with update permission will also attempt to rotate his own key,
  to validate behavior for each authentication method.

  Background:
    Given I create a new user "bob"
    And I create a new user "privileged_user"
    And I create a new user "unprivileged_user"
    And I have host "privileged_host"
    And I have host "unprivileged_host"
    And I am the super-user
    And I successfully PUT "/policies/cucumber/policy/root" with body:
    """
    - !user bob
    - !user privileged_user
    - !layer host_layer
    - !host privileged_host

  # Bob rotating his own API key

  Scenario: Bob's password CAN be used to rotate own API key
    Given I set the password for "bob" to "My-Password1"
    When I can PUT "/authn/cucumber/api_key?role=user:bob" with username "bob" and password "My-Password1"
    Then the HTTP response status code is 200
    And the result is the API key for user "bob"

  Scenario: Bob's API key CAN be used to rotate own API key
    When I can PUT "/authn/cucumber/api_key" with username "bob" and password ":cucumber:user:bob_api_key"
    Then the HTTP response status code is 200
    And the result is the API key for user "bob"

  Scenario: Bob's access token CAN NOT be used to rotate own API key
    Given I login as "bob"
    When I PUT "/authn/cucumber/api_key"
    Then the HTTP response status code is 401

  Scenario: Bob's access token CAN NOT be used to rotate own API key using role parameter with self role value
    Given I login as "bob"
    When I PUT "/authn/cucumber/api_key?role=user:bob"
    Then the HTTP response status code is 401

  # A user without update permission rotating Bob's API key

  Scenario: User without permissions CAN NOT rotate Bob's API key using their own API key

    And the result is the API key for user "bob"

  Scenario: A User with update privilege CAN NOT rotate another user's API key using their own API key
    When I PUT "/authn/cucumber/api_key?role=user:bob" with username "privileged_user" and password ":cucumber:user:privileged_user_api_key"
