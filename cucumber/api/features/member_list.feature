Feature: List and filter members of a role

The members of a role can be listed, searched, and paged.

  Background:
    Given I am the super-user
    And I successfully PUT "/policies/cucumber/policy/root" with body:
    """
    - &users
      - !user alice
      - !user bob

    - !grant
      role: !group dev
      members: *users

    - !grant
      role: !group employees
