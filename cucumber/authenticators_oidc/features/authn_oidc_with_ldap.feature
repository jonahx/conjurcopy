Feature: OIDC Authenticator - Users can authenticate with OIDC & LDAP authenticators

  In this feature we define an OIDC authenticator and LDAP authenticator
  in policy and perform authentication with Conjur. This test verifies that the
  two authenticators can live side by side without affecting each other.

  Background:
    # Configure OIDC authenticator
    Given I load a policy:
    """
    - !policy
      id: conjur/authn-oidc/keycloak
      body:
      - !webservice
        annotations:
          description: Authentication service for Keycloak, based on Open ID Connect.

      - !variable
        id: provider-uri

      - !variable
        id: id-token-user-property

      - !group users

      - !permit
        role: !group users
        privilege: [ read, authenticate ]
        resource: !webservice

    - !user alice

    - !grant
      role: !group conjur/authn-oidc/keycloak/users
      member: !user alice
    """
    And I am the super-user
    And I successfully set OIDC variables
    # Configure LDAP authenticator
    And I extend the policy with:
    """
    - !policy
      id: conjur/authn-ldap/test
      body:
      - !webservice

      - !group clients

      - !permit
        role: !group clients
        privilege: [ read, authenticate ]
        resource: !webservice

    - !grant
      role: !group conjur/authn-ldap/test/clients
      member: !user alice
    """

  Scenario: Users can authenticate with 2 authenticators
    # We want to verify the returned access token is valid for retrieving a secret
    Given I have a "variable" resource called "test-variable"
    And I permit user "alice" to "execute" it
    And I add the secret value "test-secret" to the resource "cucumber:variable:test-variable"
    # Authenticate with authn-oidc
    And I fetch an ID Token for username "alice" and password "alice"
    When I authenticate via OIDC with id token
    Then user "alice" has been authorized by Conjur
    And I successfully GET "/secrets/cucumber/variable/test-variable" with authorized user
    # Authenticate with authn-ldap
    When I login via LDAP as authorized Conjur user "alice"
    And I authenticate via LDAP as authorized Conjur user "alice" using key
    Then user "alice" has been authorized by Conjur
    And I successfully GET "/secrets/cucumber/variable/test-variable" with authorized user
